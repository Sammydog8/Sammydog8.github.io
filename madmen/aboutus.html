            <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witness these recovered SCDP relics from the mid-20th century that show the company's meager start and how far it's come since then! The first is a television commercial that aired in 1958 when SCDP was still in its infantile stages. The second is a radio interview from 1961 with Lee Garner, Jr., then owner of Lucky Strike Tobacco. </p>

            <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson Cooper, great nephew of founding partner Bertram Cooper, manages and heads one of the largest advertising firms in the United States. Beginning as a copywriter in 1981, Cooper worked diligently for 8 years before becoming Creative Director in 1989. During this position, he worked on a series of successful Nickelodeon commercials and led a Sketchers campaign that employed Britney Spears as spokesperson. In 2000, he was promoted to Account Executive where he spent 10 years signing signing client companies including Domino’s, Geico, Safeway, JetBlue, and Darden Restaurants. Cooper finally climbed to CEO in 2010, restoring Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce into the hands of the company’s namesake. Cooper strives to fuel modern productivity through creativity and innovation while maintaining a professional respect and admiration for the modest origins of SCDP. </p>
