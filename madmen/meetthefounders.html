            <h1 style="color: red;text-align: center; font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size:55">We Remember.</h1>
<h1 style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 35; text-align: center"><u>Full Partners</u></h1>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3QnIzyy.png" alt="BertCooper" />
            <h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 25; color: green"> "Philanthropy is the gateway to power."</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bertram Cooper, great uncle of current CEO Jackson Cooper, was the senior most member of the founding executives. Having launched the father company, Sterling Cooper, in 1923, he was a born leader, full of wisdom and ambition. Coming from America’s “lost generation,” his experience was the backbone of the company during its vital years of inception. As the technically first Partner of SCDP, Bert Cooper’s legacy has come full circle as his ancestor now guides the firm towards success in the modern era. After losing his life on July 20 1969, the day of America’s landing on the moon, it is appropriate and almost symbolic that Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce’s first father passed on witnessing both history and the future simultaneously.</p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/eRpkBcu.png" alt="RogerSterling" style="width:410;height:400" />
  <h3 style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 25; color: blue">"Nobody knows what I'm doing. It's good for mystique."</h3>
            <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Famous for his wit, charm, and account mastery, Roger Sterling managed Sterling Cooper along with Bert Cooper prior to its unforeseeable expansion (or, at the time, its downsize). In his attempt to live up to his father’s bequest, Sterling remained co-President through the business transition and put forth great effort to keep the company in his name. Sterling’s early good terms with Lucky Strike Tobacco served as a pedestal of security while the newfound firm attempted to land back on its feet. His love for life and conquest to live life to the fullest was a ray of sunshine during the first dark years of struggle for SCDP, and his thirst for acknowledgement is still admired and mirrored by our staff today.</p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/2Y8Vmum.png" alt="DonDraper" />
  <h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 25;color: purple"> "What you call love was invented by guys like me…to sell nylons."</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most prized and legendary savant of SCDP and advertising in general to have ever lived was Donald Draper, casually called Don. He climbed the corporate ladder from humble copywriter to head of Creative Department at Sterling Cooper and finally to full Partner and Creative Director at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. A straight shooter, it was Draper’s brilliant idea to have himself along with the other Partners terminated to free them of non-compete contracts with firms Putnam, Powell, and Lowe and McCann Erickson. Great credit is given to him for conceptualizing the SCDP known worldwide today and for always reaching for the stars which is the same attitude in all our work. Donald Draper was a living contradiction; as all great men are, he was known for his vices, but his incomparable will and determination overshadowed these flaws and molded the idolized advertising guru we revere so much now.</p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/crP2KEa.png" alt="LanePryce" />
            <h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 25; color: orange"> "I understand that all men are dizzy and powerless to refuse you, but consider me the incorruptible exception."</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the scene later than the rest, British advertiser Lane Pryce appeared as a financial officer, sent by Putnam, Powell, and Lowe who bought out Sterling Cooper. His initial job consisted of managing the financial matters of accounts behind the curtain, while Roger Sterling handled the relations side of accounts, being the skilled charmer that he was. Leading up to the final days of Sterling Cooper, Draper’s plan could have never been implemented if it were not for the faith, fortitude, and cooperation of Lane Pryce. Pryce experienced an untimely death early on in SCDP’s existence but his memory and service remain ingrained in the immortalized nostalgia for our Founding Partners.</p>

            <h1 style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 35; text-align: center"><u>Junior Partners</u></h1>
            <h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 25; color: brown"> "He has a dream, and it’s our job to make it come true."</h2>
  <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Campbell may have been the most dedicated and strong-headed ad man this company has ever seen. Upon his exit from a distinguished education at Dartmouth and coming from a historically wealthy family, Campbell set out to make a name for himself at Sterling Cooper as an account executive. His handiwork in juggling and balancing accounts with some otherwise peculiar clients, Campbell was the glue of the firm since the beginning. He is well known for never taking no for an answer; during the transition to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, Pete brought over more accounts than anyone else and thus gave the infant company a running start. Shortly after, he was granted Junior Partner status which only fueled his work ethic and productivity even more. It was then when he took independence by the reigns by opening the California branch. His loyalty is not forgotten nearly 50 years later. </p>
            <h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 25; color: pink"> "Sometimes when people get what they want they realize how limited their goals were."</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan Holloway, starting as an Office Manager in the 1950s, undoubtedly enjoyed the greatest upward mobility. She was not made Partner until a decent length of time had passed since SCDP’s founding. This occurred when she was able to land Jaguar as a client, though it was not without personal hardship. This, of course, was ongoing in conjunction with her important day-to-day job as Director of Agency Operations. Her share of the company was worth tens of millions back then, making her a commendable anomaly for women in the 1960s. Make no mistake, her success was the result of pure merit and her “rags to riches” story continues to be a model for prosperity for male and female employees alike. </p>
