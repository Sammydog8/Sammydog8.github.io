            <p style="font-size: 18px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your convenience, we have displayed some of the most frequently asked questions by real clients to potentially save you the trouble of contacting us directly.</p>
<li>"How do I get started?" From beginning your new business’s first campaign to switching ad agencies, your interest in SCDP would start with a preliminary meeting to determine your goals and financial investment so that we may present you with estimates and a plan that matches your budget. There is no contractual obligation for a consultation. </li>
<br>
<li>"Is there a minimum budget requirement?" At SCDP, we value all businesses from small mom and pop shops to global corporations. There is no minimum budget requirement but while we do welcome all business, our larger accounts will receive relatively greater attention and more experienced staff.</li>
<br>
<li>"Are all campaigns national?" No. Your campaign options consist of local, regional, national, and global scales. Campaigns become more extensive and complicated the larger they are and are priced as such.</li>
<br>
<li>"What if I only want television commercials?" SCDP offers partial campaign options in form of many media outlets, including (but not limited to) television, radio, social media, newspapers, posters/banners, venues, and aerial advertising. </li>
<br>
<li>"Can I choose who handles my account?" Yes. You may request an account representative, but may be waitlisted based on his/her availability. If you choose not to request an account representative, we will assign one to you immediately. Please be aware that certain representatives manage specifically-sized portfolios and cannot be requested by clients with smaller accounts.</li>
<br>
<li>"Where can I send items through the mail?" Please direct any mail to our headquarters in Manhattan, NY and it will be forwarded accordingly. Our Manhattan address is 1271 6th Ave, New York, NY 10020.</li>
